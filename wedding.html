                    <p>Yes, there is - Black Tie Optional! While we highly encourage formal attire, alternative options are welcome. Men are requested to wear tuxedos but may opt for dark suits instead. And while we encourage ladies to wear formal gowns, they're welcome to strut their stuff in cocktail dresses and dressy separates as well! Got a gown or some fancy pants you've been dying to wear but haven't found the right occasion for? This is it!</p>
